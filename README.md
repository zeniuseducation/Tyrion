# Tyrion

Small data analysis and machine learning framework for Clojure.  
The aim is to provide the tools normally used in data-analysis/machine-learning in Clojure in one place.  
It's built on top of common/available Clojure's related libraries like core.matrix and gorilla repl.

Why not broken-down into small libraries?   
Because it's easier to start this way, and we're using most of it anyway :)
